In~\cite{ParkKFGAP18}, it is observed that the cost for validating
a deadline is quadratic in $\numberofscoops$,
since (Def.~\ref{def:deadline_validity}) it
requires to recontruct a nonce through
Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction}. At the time, the web page of
Burstcoin still presented that algorithm
without the $\kappa$ threshold of step~\ref{step:nonce_construction:first_hash}
and its complexity, in terms of $\numberofscoops$, was actually quadratic.
This might be seen as a (very theoretical)
security issue if $\numberofscoops$ is very large
and $\beat$ is very small (Tab.~\ref{tab:notations}). In that case,
peers might not have enough time to verify the blocks whispered
from their connected peers and the network might split.
The addition of the $\kappa$ threshold makes the complexity
of deadline validation linear in $\numberofscoops$ now
(Prop.~\ref{prop:nonce_construction_complexity}), hence this
issue has been solved.
