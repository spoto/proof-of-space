\section{Improvements}

Cite~\cite{TangZDWLG0L19}. They tackle the problem of miners using the same stored data
for many chains. This is problematic for newborn chains, since they might get an attack
from miners (or coalition of miners) that already use a very big data file for mining other,
mature chains (\emph{newborn attack}). They present a solution over the SpaceMint protocol.
The idea is that the disk space of a miner can be split for mining on many chains
simultaneously, but there is an incentive at allocating a space, for each chain, proportional
to the market value of the chain.
