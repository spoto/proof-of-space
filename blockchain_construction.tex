\section{Blockchain Construction}\label{sec:blockchain_construction}

The blockchain is a tree of blocks. Since only the trunks of the blocks are
relevant for the proof of space, this section defines how a tree of trunks
is constructed, rooted at an initial \emph{genesis} trunk. The collection,
selection, execution and inclusion o fthe transactions inside blocks is
completely abstracted away in this formalization.

\begin{definition}\label{def:blockchain}
  A \emph{blockchain} is a set $B\subset\Trunks$ such that $\bot\in B$.
\end{definition}
