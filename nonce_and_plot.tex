\section{Nonces and Plots}\label{sec:nonces_and_plots}

This section formalizes the notions of nonce and plot, a collection of nonces, and their
algorithmic construction. Signum requires miners to hold one or more plots
on disk. Their initialization is performed only once and offline, hence it is
not part of the mining protocol.

Tab.~\ref{tab:notations} collects notations introduced here and used throughout the paper.
It also reports specific choices
made in~\cite{SignumPlotting} (rightmost column), but this paper remains parametric \wrt them.
For genericity, our formalization uses three hashing functions, that might actually coincide.

The following definitions are used to deal with bytes and hashing.
%
\begin{definition}[Concatenation operator $\bowtie$]
  Sequences (for instance, of bytes) are concatenated by $\bowtie$. The same $\bowtie$
  is used to concatenate a sequence to an element or an element to a sequence.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}[$\nattobe$ and $\betonat$]
  The operators $\nattobe$ and $\betonat$ transform natural numbers
  into their big-endian byte representation, and vice versa.
\end{definition}
%
\begin{definition}[Hashing function]
  A \emph{hashing function} $h$ of $\size>0$
  is a total map $h:\mathit{byte}^*\to\mathit{byte}^\size$, where
  $\mathit{byte}^*$ is a sequence of bytes, of arbitrary length,
  and $\mathit{byte}^\size$ is a sequence of $\size$ bytes, called a \emph{hash} for $h$.
  If $h$ is a hashing function, then $\size(h)$ is its size.
\end{definition}

A \emph{scoop} is a pair of hashes.
A \emph{nonce} is a natural \emph{progressive number} $p$, and
a list of $\numberofscoops>0$ scoops.
%or, equivalenty,
%a list of $2\cdot\numberofscoops$ hashes for $h_\deadline$.
Their definitions are parametric \wrt the hashing function $h_\deadline$ used for their creation.
%
\begin{definition}[Scoop, Nonce]
  The sets of \emph{scoops} and \emph{nonces} are
  \begin{align*}
    \Scoops&=\left\{\langle h_1,h_2\rangle\left|\begin{array}{l}
    h_1,h_2\text{ are hashes for }h_\deadline
    \end{array}\right.\right\},\\
    \Nonces&=\left\{\langle p,\scoops\rangle\left|\begin{array}{l}
    p\in\mathbb{N}\text{ and }\scoops\in\Scoops^\numberofscoops
    \end{array}\right.\right\}.
  \end{align*}
\end{definition}
%
In the above definition, angular brackets stand for tuples (in this specific
case, they stand for pairs). When definitions are given in terms of tuples,
it is silently assumed that there are selection functions
for the elements of the tuple. For instance, if $\nonce\in\Nonces$, then $\nonce.p$
and $\nonce.\scoops$ are its elements.

A \emph{prolog} is the identifier of the creator of nonces and plots (for instance, its public key).
For now, it is just a sequence of bytes. Sec.~\ref{sec:prolog_structure_attacks}
will give structure to prologs and see how they can be useful.
%
\begin{definition}[Prolog]\label{def:prolog}
  The set of \emph{prologs} is $\Prologs=\{\pi\mid\pi\in\mathit{bytes}^*\}$.
\end{definition}
%
The following algorithm constructs a nonce, given its progressive number and a prolog.
It uses a constant $\kappa>0$ (Tab.~\ref{tab:notations})
to limit its computational cost, by avoiding hashing very large chunks of data.
%
\begin{alg}[$\nonce(p,\pi)$]\label{alg:nonce_construction}
  Given $p\in\mathbb{N}$ and $\pi\in\Prologs$, we define
  \[
  \nonce(p,\pi)=\langle p,\langle h_0,h_1\rangle\append
  \cdots\append\langle h_{2\cdot\numberofscoops-2},h_{2\cdot\numberofscoops-1}\rangle\rangle\in\Nonces,
  \]
  where the hashes $h_0,\ldots,h_{2\cdot\numberofscoops-1}$ are constructed as
  follows\footnote{Step.~\ref{step:nonce_construction:swap} and the threshold $\kappa$
  have been added after the publication of~\cite{ParkKFGAP18},
  in response to some of their criticisms.
  See Sec.~\ref{sec:prolog_structure_attacks}.}.
  %
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Let $\seed=\pi\append\nattobe(p)$.
  \item\label{step:nonce_construction:first_hash}
    For each $i$ from $2\cdot\numberofscoops-1$ to $0$,
    let\footnote{In~\cite{SignumPlotting}, it is said to
    take the \emph{last} $\kappa$ bytes, that would be meaningless since then
    the lowest $h_i$'s would coincide. An inspection of their code
    shows that they actually take the \emph{first} $\kappa$ bytes. They
    probably use \emph{last} here in the sense of \emph{more recently computed}.}
    \[
    h_i=h_\deadline\left(\text{first $\kappa$ bytes of}\left(\left(\append_{i<j<2\cdot\numberofscoops}h_j\right)\append\seed\right)\right).
    \]
  \item\label{step:nonce_construction:final_hash}
    Let
    \[
    \finalhash=h_\deadline\left(\left(\append_{0\le j<2\cdot\numberofscoops}h_j\right)\append\seed\right).
    \]
  \item For each $i$ from $0$ to $2\cdot\numberofscoops-1$, reassign
    $h_i$ to $h_i\xor\finalhash$.
  \item\label{step:nonce_construction:swap}
    For each odd $i$ from $1$ to $2\cdot\numberofscoops-1$, swap
    $h_i$ with $h_{2\cdot\numberofscoops-i}$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{alg}
%
%As usual in this context, the complexity of the algorithm is better expressed
%in terms of how much data is hashed, since that is the expensive operation that dominates
%Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction}. The following result assumes that
%integers use a finite machine representation (for instance, $8$ bytes for \texttt{long} in Java)
%and that prologs have a fixed structure and length.
%
%\begin{proposition}\label{prop:nonce_construction_complexity}
%  The execution of Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction}, in terms
%  of $\kappa$ and $\numberofscoops$, requires to hash
%  $O(\kappa\cdot\numberofscoops)$ bytes with $h_\deadline$.
%\end{proposition}
%\begin{proof}
%  Step~\ref{step:nonce_construction:first_hash} of Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction}
%  hashes at most $\kappa$ bytes and gets iterated $2\cdot\numberofscoops$ times.
%  Step~\ref{step:nonce_construction:final_hash} hashes
%  $2\cdot\numberofscoops\cdot\size(h_\deadline)+|\pi|+\log(p)$ bytes. Therefore,
%  Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction} hashes a number of bytes that is
%  \begin{align*}
%    &O(2\cdot\kappa\cdot\numberofscoops+2\cdot\numberofscoops\cdot\size(h_\deadline)+|\pi|+\log(p))\\
%    \text{(constants)}&=O(2\cdot\kappa\cdot\numberofscoops+2\cdot\numberofscoops)\\
%    \text{(since $\kappa>0$)}&=O(2\cdot\kappa\cdot\numberofscoops)\\
%    &=O(\kappa\cdot\numberofscoops).
%  \end{align*}
%  \qed
%\end{proof}
%
A \emph{plot} is a set of nonces constructed with Alg.~\ref{alg:nonce_construction},
for a finite non-empty set of progressive numbers $P$ and
for a given prolog $\pi$, recorded in the plot.
%
\begin{definition}[Plot]\label{def:plot}
  The set of \emph{plots} is defined as
  \[
  \Plots=\left\{\left<\pi,\nonces\right>\left|\begin{array}{l}
  \pi\in\Prologs,\ \varnothing\not=P\subset\mathbb{N}\text{ is finite}\\
  \text{and }\nonces=\left\{\nonce(p,\pi)\left|\;p\in P\right.\right\}
  \end{array}\right.\right\}.
  \]
\end{definition}
%
The computations of $\nonce(p,\pi)$ and $\nonce(p',\pi)$, for $p\not=p'$,
are completely independent. Therefore, Def.~\ref{def:plot}
implies that the construction of a plot can be optimized on
multicore hardware.
